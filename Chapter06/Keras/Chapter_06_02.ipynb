The next two values are the width and height which is reduced by 2 due to the size of the kernel filters, the stride and the padding. If we were to set the padding argument to \"same\" rather than \"valid\" the dimensions of the output would remain the same as the input. Play around with the kernel size stride and padding so that you get a feel as to what it does. The reasons behind this were exaplained earlier on in the chapter \"Intro to Convolutional Neural Networks\". The final dimension is the number of filters/kernels."
